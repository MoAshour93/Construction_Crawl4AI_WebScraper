### Description

This notice is placed in order to facilitate early engagement with potential providers, and relates only to a pre\-procurement market briefing.

NHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight (HIOW) Integrated Care Board (ICB) are seeking to commission Mandatory Dental Services (MDS) on the Isle of Wight, and will be holding a procurement process to award new contracts for service commencement from April 2025\.

Prospective bidders are warmly invited to a pre\-procurement market briefing event held virtually through Microsoft Teams on the following date:

5pm \- 7pm Friday 8th November 2024 by MS Teams

The event has been arranged to take place to avoid any clash with clinical sessions and will be hosted online.

The procurement(s) are anticipated to commence from early November 2024, inviting tenders to deliver services for specific lotted areas, with phased contract commencement anticipated in the period from April to September 2025\.

The procurement is anticipated to be split into a number of Lots as follows:\-

Lot 5C1\-1: Isle of Wight (21k)
Lot 5C1\-2: Isle of Wight (14k)
Lot 5C1\-3: West Wight

A maximum of one contract will be awardable in each Lot, except in the case of Lot 5C1\-1, where a maximum of 2 contracts will be awardable.

The commissioners anticipate contracting for services under PDS agreements for a period of up to 10 years. This procurement is being carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioner.

To allow potential providers to reflect on the proposed services, the Commissioner has provided early indicative information as part of this notice.

At the briefing, we will share further detail of the commissioner's objectives, the proposed specification for the service, lotting intentions and pricing strategy. We will also provide details of the e\-Procurement system (being used to procure these services) and how the procurement and selection process will operate.

To access the information suite and express an interest, interested providers should register on the e\-procurement system, Atamis, available on the following link: [https://health\-family.force.com/s/Welcome](https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome) and express interest via the 'Live Opportunities' list.

Please note that you will need to be registered on Atamis and select the option to 'register an interest' under the project Market Briefing: Mandatory Dental Services (MDS) on the Isle of Wight, followed by completing and submitting the Market Briefing Event Registration form.

In order to attend the Market Briefing Event, please ensure that you submit the registration form via Atamis by no later than 12 Noon on Wednesday 6th November 2024, including your contact details as requested. Details on how to access the briefing will be provided to all responses received prior to this closing date.

### More information

**Additional text**

The briefing event is open to all providers who may want to deliver NHS mandatory dental services in the future. In order to establish fair representation, availability for this event is limited to a maximum of two individuals per organisation.

Lots:
5C1\-1 Isle of Wight (21k)
A maximum of 2 contracts will be awardable in this Lot, each for total UDA activity of 21,000 UDAs.

5C1\-2 Isle of Wight (14k)
A maximum of 1 contract will be awardable in this Lot, for total UDA activity of 14,000 UDAs.

5C1\-3 West Wight
A maximum of 1 contract will be awardable in this Lot, for total UDA activity of 12,000 UDAs.

Providers are reminded that the information documents provided in Atamis are indicative draft versions only and subject to change. Providers should not rely upon these documents when submitting any future bids, instead referring to the tender documentation released with the relevant tender opportunity.

This notice is an information gathering exercise rather than a call for competition in its own right, and therefore publication or response does not commit the Authority or respondents to a future procurement, nor provide any process exemptions or preferential treatment to any parties expressing an interest. Commissioners are looking to establish what interest there might be in providing such a service from suitably qualified, capable and competent organisations.

The Authority will not be liable for costs incurred by any interested party in participating in this exercise. Interested parties should note that a response to this notice does not guarantee an automatic invitation to any subsequent formal procurement, which the commissioners will consider in due course.

The intention is to award a contract using the competitive process.

This is a Provider Selection Regime (PSR) prior information notice. The contract is subject to the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023\. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 do not apply.

### How to apply
